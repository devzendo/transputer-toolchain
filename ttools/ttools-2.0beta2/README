WHAT IS TTOOLS

TTOOLS is free package comprising assembler, linker, loader(s), and
auxiliary programs intended for software development for transputers.

TTOOLS is designed to work with gcc-t800, a port of GNU C/C++ Compiler
to transputers.  You need gcc-2.6.3-t800.7 or newer; older versions
use a slightly different flavor of assembly language.

Both TTOOLS and gcc-t800 are known to work on i486-linux platform.
As they use mostly basic system interfaces, it should not be
hard to port them to other Un*xes, but I didn't try this.
