Welcome!  Here lives gcc-t800, the port of GNU C Compiler to the
transputer architecture.  Naming conventions for files beneath this
directory are as follows:

  gcc-2.x.x-t800.NNN.dif.gz is the transputer port in the form of
  context diff against the official GCC distribution, gcc-2.x.x.tar.gz.
  You most probably want to pick the file with largest NNN.

  gcc-2.x.x.tar.gz is the official GCC distribution, version 2.x.x.
  You can download it from here, but it is large.  So you probably
  will be happier downloading it from the nearest to you FTP site
  that carries GNU software.

  patchNNN.gz contains diff between gcc-2.x.x-t800.MMM and
  gcc-2.x.x-t800.NNN, where MMM=NNN-1.  This is meant for upgrades.

  changesNNN contain a short overview of the changes in version
  gcc-2.x.x-t800.NNN.

gcc-2.7.2-t800.1 is roughly equivalent to gcc-2.6.3-t800.10
transputer-wise.  The 2.6.3 branch is not expected to be developed
further, except for bugfixes.
